</p>

Welcome to my **BASED** neovim configuration!

**BASED** means that my config is only one init.lua file no Lazy.nvim or other external package loaders dependencies.
You must have **neovim 0.12.0+** because it uses native plugin loading via `vim.pack.add()`.
So feel free to explore! It's well documented (I think) and self-explanatory.

Some of the keymaps taked from [vim.rtorr.com](https://vim.rtorr.com/) and also constantly updating when I explore new motions from help documentation `:h/:help`.

    <summary>Extend mode</summary>

Once you enter the Extend mode, you can expand or shrink your selections using Vim motions or Treesitter nodes.
At first, the left side of the selections stays put, and selections get extended from the right side.
But you can change which side of selections stay put by pressing `o`.
